Let’s Encrypt:

There are more people using the internet each day and with this growing activity it is important to ensure internet security. HTTPS connections are a secure way to connect to websites. This is important when purchasing things online or sending private information about yourself such as a social security number over the internet. A certificate is a way for the device or computer to remember that https connection and ensure that it will be secure each and every time it connects. What Let’s Encrypt offers is a way to set up these certificates for free. There are many sponsors but I will name a few of the big named ones: Mozilla, Cisco, Facebook, Hewlett Packard, shopify, and Google chrome. The current board members are: Josh Aas (Mozilla) — ISRG Executive Director, Stephen Ludin (Akamai), J. Alex Halderman (University of Michigan), Jennifer Granick (Stanford Law School), Laura Thomson (Mozilla), Joe Hildebrand (Cisco), Peter Eckersley (EFF), Alex Polvi (CoreOS), and Pascal Jaillon (OVH). I was unable to find the documentation that states how they review the code fix recommendations. All of their code is pushed on github but there is no clear way on how to report a fix in the code or the process on how they check if the fix is correct or not. There is a posting area that you can post issues that will then be worked on. I found this a little different than the other open source projects I was reviewing because on other projects they will accept recommendations which they will then review. Once it is reviewed by two of their members then they apply the fix. 

This project seems very useful but maybe does not have many errors that need to be fixed. I noticed on their home page that they are now moving from beta stage which shows their growth. Their founder sponsor, Cisco, signed a three-year commitment plan with Let’s Encrypt. “Cisco is committed to improving the security of the Internet, not only for our customers and partners, but for everyone else as well,” says David Ward, CTO of Engineering and Chief Architect at Cisco. “Let’s Encrypt has been doing impressive work toward that goal. Our support of this community towards real-time, on-demand certificates will make the Internet more secure.”
Let’s Encrypt started their first beta on November 1, 2015 which only issued a few thousand certificates. They have now issued more than 1.7 million certificates for more than 3.8 million websites. With such big named companies sponsoring Let’s Encrypt I would expect them to issue out more certificates exponentially. Let’s Encrypt client software is a Python-based utility that works alongside Apache to automatically obtain a certificate and convert a website into HTTPS. 

In order to get involved you can follow them on their website at https://letsencrypt.org. On their website they post a blog showing and updating their progress. They also have a twitter account in which you can follow to keep updated with their progress. Let’s Encrypt has a community website that is dedicated to answering questions people may have. This is also a great place to share issues people may be having. If anyone is not sure how to implement the client or set up Let’s Encrpyt on the server side, the community website shows you step by step. Their headquarters is on York Street, San Francisco.
